      <p>Hi, I'm Kyle Kowalski - I am a lifelong student with a professional focus on all things IT.  In school I focused on problem solving; specifically, using technology as a solution to problems. There always seems to be a better way to do things, a better solution that just requires a little work to get there.  </p>
      <p>This desire to help lead me to a career serving as a systems administrator - my focus was primarily on Microsoft Windows systems and the myriad of associated software suites.  I found a wonderful niche in <i>systems automation</i>.  My team seemed to function a lot better when a system was automated and monitored well.  Bonus points for having a system tell you what was broken and how to fix it.  </p>
      <p>My drive for automation lead me to scripting:  <strong>PowerShell</strong>.  I have to admit, I really enjoyed learning PowerShell.  I was able to make huge swaths of my job disappear from my day-to-day work.  The basic monitoring and maintenance tasks were automated and I simply had to deal with any issues that were brought to my attention -- usually an email from the monitor on an ailing system.  It was <strong>beautiful</strong>.  </p>
      <p>The cloud changed my career.  Systems are disappearing into the cloud at a rapid pace - admins can scale and monitor many many more systems then they ever could before.  My ability to deal with the issues directly was dimished, so I started to look elseware, how could I get my hands back into things? </p>
      <p>Coding!  It seems my career has lead to this destination <i>(for the moment, at least)</i>, I wish to establish myself as a coder.  To do this, I need a portfolio of work that I can present... and that is why we're here.  </p>
      <p>Enjoy! </p>
      <p>- Kyle</p>
